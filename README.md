# GeometricToolsEngine3p16

This is just a fork of https://www.geometrictools.com/index.html, not official repository.

Geometric Tools Engine 3.16. The distribution was posted on October 3, 2018. The following operating systems and compilers are supported, and testing was performed on all systems. GTEngine requires OpenGL 4.3 (or later) and GLSL 4.3 (or later) in order to support compute shaders and GLSL introspection.

Microsoft Windows 10 with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. The code should also work on Microsoft Windows 8.1, 8.0 and 7. Tested with NVIDIA and Intel HD drivers. 

Linux distributions with proprietary NVIDIA drivers installed: Linux Mint 18 (MATE), Ubuntu 16.04, OpenSUSE Leap 42.2, Debian 8.5.0 and Fedora 27. If you use the Nouveau Open Source drivers that ship with Linux, and if those drivers do not support OpenGL 4.3 or later, any attempt to run the sample applications will fail gracefully with the console-window output: OpenGL 4.3 is required.

I no longer support the Macintosh. Comments about this are in the installation and release notes.
